Insurance Terms and Conditions

This document outlines the terms and conditions governing the insurance policy, including coverage scope, exclusions, claim procedures, and policyholder responsibilities.

Coverage:

The insurance policy covers inpatient hospitalization, surgical procedures including knee surgeries, outpatient treatments, diagnostic services, and emergency care. Coverage limits and deductibles vary based on policy type and individual agreements.

Exclusions:

The policy excludes coverage for cosmetic surgeries, experimental treatments, alternative medicine therapies, and injuries resulting from illegal activities or self-harm. Certain high-risk procedures require explicit insurer approval prior to treatment.

Claims Process:

Policyholders must submit claims within 30 days of receiving medical services. Required documentation includes medical reports, hospital bills, prescriptions, and discharge summaries. Failure to provide complete documentation may delay claim processing or lead to denial.

Claims are reviewed by medical experts appointed by the insurer to verify necessity and coverage eligibility. Disputed claims can be appealed through formal grievance procedures.

Policy Renewal and Cancellation:

Renewal requires timely premium payment before policy expiration. Non-payment leads to policy lapse, resulting in loss of coverage. The insurer reserves the right to cancel policies for fraud, misrepresentation, or violation of terms.

Premiums may be adjusted at renewal based on claims history, inflation, and risk assessment. Policyholders will receive notification at least 30 days prior to premium changes.

Co-Payments and Deductibles:

Certain procedures require policyholders to pay co-payments or deductibles. These amounts are specified in the policy schedule and vary according to treatment type and hospital category.

Pre-Authorization:

Pre-authorization from the insurer is mandatory for all planned surgeries and hospital admissions. Emergency admissions require notification within 24 hours.

Data Privacy:

The insurer commits to protecting the privacy of policyholders’ personal and medical information, adhering to applicable data protection laws.

Grievance Redressal:

Policyholders have access to multiple channels for complaint resolution, including customer service hotlines, online portals, and insurance ombudsman offices.

Contact Information:

For inquiries, claim status, or assistance, policyholders may contact customer support via phone, email, or the insurer’s website.
